**Mall Customer Segmentation**

Managed the Mall customer dataset from Kaggle, addressed 10% missing values, and optimized the dataset by dropping two
unnecessary columns. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, generating 10+ visualizations (histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps) to analyze customer demographics and spending behavior, uncovering key trends and insights, including spending patterns according to gender, age, and income.
Applied K-Means clustering to segment 200 customers based on age, annual income, and spending score, determining the optimal number of clusters (k=5) using the elbow method. Designed and analyzed 10+ 2D and 3D scatter plots to visualize clustering results, identifying and interpreting 5 distinct customer segments for strategic business insights.
